# Humility

Let me start this out with a quote I like. 😊

"You can learn something from everyone, even a broken clock is right twice a day." ⏰

This may not necessarily sound like a content-writing or copywriting post, but it definitely is. ✍️

If you take this as a motivational speech, it works too.

As a writer, you are not an island 🏝️ of knowledge.

Yes, you know a lot about writing 📖 and creating content that generates leads and increases conversion.

But you can't know it all. And here is the good part: you are not expected to know it all. Is that an excuse to be a lazy content writer? No. 

The content world 🌍 is an active one, and the growth of the industry is fast and consistent. 📚

 As such, new things are coming on board daily.

As a seasoned ☁️ 🌨️ writer, you may be tempted to claim you know all, considering your longevity and efficiency, but that is not always true.

There are different skills ⚔️ every writer possesses, and as such, what a newbie might have, you as a pro might lack. 

Humility lets you drop your ego aside and network properly to learn from everyone around you.

# Summary

Is it easy? Probably not; it can be relative.

Some clients like to prove that they know it all themselves, and they can be some of the most difficult people to deal with. 

However, humility will let you see the bigger picture, accommodate their "know it all" attitude and deliver value to them.
