You can choose between two types of properties: *URL-prefix property or Domain property*.
URL-prefix properties focus on specific URLs under a website's main domain. They are ideal for tracking a particular section or version of your website.

The domain property tracks data across your entire domain, including subdomains and both HTTP and HTTPS versions. They provide comprehensive data coverage for your entire website.

GSC offers several verification methods, each with its pros and cons. In this article, we'll focus on the meta tag verification method. Why? It's relatively simple and doesn't require messing around with file uploads or editing HTML code.

When prompted to select a verification method, opt for the meta tag option. GSC will provide you with a unique meta tag code snippet. Copy the meta tag code snippet provided by GSC. Then, paste it into the <head> section of your website's HTML code. Make sure to place it just before the closing </head> tag.
Once you've added the meta tag to your site's HTML, return to GSC and click the *"Verify"* button. GSC will check for the presence of the meta tag on your site and confirm ownership if it's detected successfully.
